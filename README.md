# Puzzle_Game

A puzzle game I made to practice programming.

Practiced working with object inheritence, GUI, action listeners, sprites, multiple threads, etc.

The project is currently under construction.

---------------------------------------------------

Controls:

* w -> move left
* r -> move right
* e -> climb up
* d -> climb down
* s -> dig left
* f -> dig right
* u -> drop first item
* i -> drop second item
* o -> drop third item
* p -> drop fourth item

Goal:

Collect all coins.  Then exit through open door to go to the next level. You can dig blocks to get coins that are buried.  This game is a puzzle game.  All levels are possible, though some might require some thought.  

You can collect items.  Currently the only ones are explosives.  Items can be picked up.  When you drop an explosive it will ignite and detonate after a few seconds blowing up blocks.  Each type of explosive blows up blocks in a different way.  Horizontal ones blow up two blocks to the left and right.  Vertical explosives blow up blocks vertically, the cross shaped explosive blows up blocks both horizontally and vertically.  The short round one blows up every adjacent block.
